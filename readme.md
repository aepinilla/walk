# Moon Walk

This is a personal project where I experimented doing a photo montage of people walking in a sky full of moons. Then, I used Processing to animate it.

## How does it work?
- Clic and a new moon will be created (up to 7 moons).
- Press the space bar and a moon will be eliminated.

## Requirements
You need to install Processing to run the files: https://processing.org/download/

## Technologies and tools used:
- Photoshop
- Processing 3
