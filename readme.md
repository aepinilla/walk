# Moon Walk

This is a personal project where I experimented doing a photo montage of people walking in a sky full of moons. Then, I used Processing to animate it.

## Instructions
1. Install Processing: https://processing.org/download/
2. Download the repository or clone it in your computer.
3. Open the file "walk.pde"
4. Press crtl + r (Windows) or cmd + r (Mac)

## How does it work?
- Clic and a new moon will be created (up to 7 moons).
- Press the space bar and a moon will be eliminated.

## Technologies and tools used:
- Photoshop
- Processing 3
