# Moon Walk

This is a personal project where I experimented doing a photo montage of people walking in a sky full of moons. Then, I used Processing to animate it.

## How does it work?
- If you clic on in a new moon will be created (up to 7 moons).
- If you press the space bar, a moon will be eliminated.

## Requirements
You need to install Processing to run this : https://processing.org/download/

## Technologies and tools used:
- Photoshop
- Processing 3
